## Build MicroShift Upstream

### Overview
The build process is containerized and it includes the following steps:

1. Replace the MicroShift payload/images with the OKD [released images](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/releases).
1. Build the MicroShift RPMs and repository from the MicroShift sources.
1. Build the `microshift-okd` Bootc container based on CentOS Stream.

### Prerequisites

Install software necessary for following the build process on CentOS Stream systems:
```bash
sudo dnf install make podman -y
```

### Build Options

Building MicroShift artifacts is performed by running `make rpm` or `make image`
commands.

The following options can be specified in the make command line using the
`NAME=VAL` format.

| Name                   | Required | Default  | Comments
|------------------------|----------|----------|---------
| USHIFT_BRANCH          | no       | main     | [List of branches](https://github.com/openshift/microshift/branches)
| OKD_VERSION_TAG        | yes      |          | [List of tags](https://quay.io/repository/okd/scos-release?tab=tags)
| RPM_OUTDIR             | no       | /tmp/... | RPM repository output directory for `make rpm`
| WITH_KINDNET           | no       | 1        | OVK-K CNI is used when Kindnet is disabled
| WITH_TOPOLVM           | no       | 1        | Enable [TopoLVM](https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm) CSI
| WITH_OLM               | no       | 0        | Enable OLM support
| EMBED_CONTAINER_IMAGES | no       | 0        | Embed all component container dependencies in Bootc images

### Build MicroShift RPMs

Run the `make rpm` command to build MicroShift RPMs based on CentOS Stream 9
operating system.

```
USHIFT_BRANCH=release-4.19
OKD_VERSION_TAG=4.19.0-okd-scos.19

make rpm \
  USHIFT_BRANCH="${USHIFT_BRANCH}" \
  OKD_VERSION_TAG="${OKD_VERSION_TAG}"
```

If the build completes successfully, the MicroShift RPM repository is copied to
the `RPM_OUTDIR` directory on the host. The packages from this repository can be
used to install MicroShift on the supported operating systems.

Note: The path to the `RPM_OUTDIR` directory (either temporary or specified in
the `make rpm` command line) is displayed in the end of the build procedure.

```
...
...
Build completed successfully
RPMs are available in '/tmp/microshift-rpms-EI3IXg'
```

### Build MicroShift Bootc Image

Run the `make image` command to build a MicroShift Bootc image based on CentOS
Stream 9 operating system with the default options.

```bash
USHIFT_BRANCH=release-4.19
OKD_VERSION_TAG=4.19.0-okd-scos.19

make image \
  USHIFT_BRANCH="${USHIFT_BRANCH}" \
  OKD_VERSION_TAG="${OKD_VERSION_TAG}"
```

If the build completes successfully, the `microshift-okd` image is created.
